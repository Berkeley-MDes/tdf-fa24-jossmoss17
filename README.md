## Week 3: Progress Report 3 - 09/19/24
#### My Reflections on the TDF Project 1
Over the weekend, I subconsciously was thinking about TDF Project 1. I'm not interested in making a phone stand, and I'm thinking that I want to create something that will bring joy to my housemate and my life. I'm thinking either a smiski stand or a vase.

On Saturday, I saw these vases I was interested in potentially replicating.

## Week 2: Progress Report 2 - 09/12/24

Hi! This is my second progress report for TDF. A lot has been happening and we're in the third week of school. It has been busy, to say the least. 

#### My Reflections
* First half of this "week" was figuring out how to laser-cut. It was very nerve-wracking, but I did it and now I feel like I am a video game character that level-ed up and unlocked a skill. The next thing is 3d printing, but in order to 3d print; I need to 3d model. And I made the executive decision to prioritize other things in my life over TDF. I know I want to learn technical skills, so this is still very important to me. I also acknowledge that setting this aside means I have to pick up more slack when I come back to this.

#### My Proudest Accomplishments
* Looking ahead and timing submitting Github Progress Reports on time and consistently.
* Successfully setting up and laserprinting an object. 🎉
* Asking and collaborating with peers to laserprint an object. Watching their process.
* Spending a significant amount of time understand what Grasshopper does generally.
* Opening and testing grasshopper to some extent.

#### My Speculations
* Why does the professor want us to do Grasshopper when there are other tools like Blendr or even AI Text to CAD? I think I know why, but I want him to say why.

#### My Blockers/Fears
* This week I prioritized working on my portfolio and the studio class over TDF. I recognize that I didn't spend much time really getting to know Grasshopper/Rhino as I should have.
* I'm horrible at math and using grasshopper requires a level of geometry and calculus that I've forgotten. 
* I can't download Rhino on my personal laptop so I can't follow along in class.
* I'm afraid I'm not giving myself enough time to understand grasshopper at a deeper level.
* I get really tired at 5 PM when we're having class and it is hard for me to pay attention by the time it is 5 pm. I've been trying to bring snacks to prevent being completely exhausted.
* I'm afraid of submitting the TDF project due next Wednesday. I don't think I've learned much and don't have much to showcase from the last few weeks.
 
#### My Plans
* Next week, carve more time to practice Grasshopper/Rhino.
* Learn markdown formatting to add photos into this Github .readme file
* Ask others for help (peers, professors, design specialists, chatgpt)
* Submit the TDF project 1 on time.
* 3d print anything. 

  

## Week 1: Progress Report 1 - 09/05/24

Hi there! Welcome to my first entry of my progress report. This past week has been very stressful in the TDF world. I think this component/class is where I am the weakest because I avoided anything CS/math related throughout highschool/university. I am naturally adverse to anything technical, which is ironic because I am doing my Master of Design in Emerging Technology. 

#### My Reflections
* This course is definitely the most stressful and nerve-wracking due to my lack of technical skill. It requires me to stay up-to-date and very cognizant of what I do know and what I will need to learn (and the time it takes to learn) and how I will learn it. As a result, I've been thoroughly reading through all things and asking questions wherever I have concerns. (Asking in Slack, Whatsapp, Chatgpt, etc. I also reinforce a reminder that I'm here optionally and I'm paying for this. So get asking!!!) I've begun to notice an immediate pay-off (resulting from my fears): it seems some of my peers are asking the same questions, but days after I resolved them. Maybe my fear of being behind is forcing me to be so proactive that maybe I'll be "successful"? (Whatever I define as "success.")
* I reached out to my friends and chatgpt to understand how Github works and how to use it.
* I reached out to tutorials and videos to understand how Rhino works and how to use it.
* I think I am in a solid spot because I'm being very proactive.

#### My Proudest Accomplishments
* I spent a significant amount of time with Chatgpt understanding what Github even is, how it works, and why we are using it. (I also spent time understanding how Github relates to business users, developers, and product designers). ((I segwayed into learning how Jira integrates with Github))
  * From my understanding, Github houses the code and here is where you store any code-changes via branches. It is also good for collaboration/version control/asset keeping.
  * (((I forced a developer friend of mine to teach me how to write progress reports the easy way. He mentioned that the way I'm doing it right now is not industry-standard but the "easy-way". When deciding between which path to take; I'm a designer and I don't think its necessary for me to do it the industry-way...)))
* I spent a significant amount of time reading all the various links on Github so now I have a clear understanding of what is expected out of me and what I can come to expect in the coming weeks/months in the TDF course.
* I downloaded and watched several Rhino tutorials and have a very baseline understanding of how it all works.
* I watched/read up about the requirements for the first project of computational design.

#### My Speculations
* I'm excited that Github isn't as scary as it was last week. I can commit changes and navigate throughout pages. It will continue to be easier as I learn specific markdown formatting over time.
* I'm excited to actually 3D print something. I know it is probably easier than I'm making it out to be in my mind.
* I'm curious how the AI/ML portion will integrate into this phone stand design. I've been thinking about how I often prop my phone up on my laptop during class to hide my phone usage from professors. Sometimes I also prop my phone up during meetings when my camera is on so I can scroll on my phone whilst not looking away from the general camera square. 

#### My Blockers/Fears
* I don't really understand the difference between computational designer and product designer. I watched some of the videos but it started blurring/getting fuzzy in my mind.
* I don't know how to 3D model --> 3D print. I need to try it out myself this week.
* I am scared of burning my skin and giving myself an allergic reaction. 

#### My Plans
* I want to ask Mia how to use 3D printing. She seems to know a lot and I could learn a lot from her expertise from a peer-to-peer perspective.
* I need to spend time actually 3D printing something. Anything. I'm thinking something cute and funky like a Smiski. That is the most daunting process to me. 
* I need to watch more tutorials on how to create 3D models in Rhino and exporting to the Jacob's computer to print.
* I need to reach out in-person to my professors, design specialists, and faculty to introduce myself as a person.
* I need to figure out Grasshopper altogether. That part I left out because its a plug-in.
* I need to review markdown formatting page. 



## Week 0: Example Report 0 - 09/05/2024

This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

# Github Background Information & Context
If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

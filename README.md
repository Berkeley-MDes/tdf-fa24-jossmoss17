## Week 12: Progress Report 13 - 12/5/24

Hi! Happy post-thanksgiving! We only have two weeks-- less than two weeks until the semester wraps up. Isn't that crazy!!!! Wowee. We've made significant progress in our work and came across a few bumps in the way, but it will get done!! 

#### Reflections
Our architecture has changed over time as we conducted experiments and tested what worked. Due to primarily time and effort constraint, we're focusing on 

Inputs (From User One)
* 3 FSR Sensors (Input to measure activity)
* 1 Photoreceptor (Input to show wearing/not wearing)
* 1 GPS API (Input to calculate location)

Connected through Edge Impulse and Cloud

Outputs (To User Two)
* Mobile Web Browser experience (Ability to see location, activity, measurement)

## Week 12: Progress Report 12 - 11/24/24
Hello! This is week 12 and I'm looking forward to beginning TDF Project 4. I had a great call with Jeff on Friday and he kindly walked me through different requirements. This next project I'm looking to mix, master, extend, and evolve computational design, digital ecosystems, fine-tuning llms, and collaborative design platforms. 

I met with Upasana and Hongxi to decide on our project and we've decided to focus on designing a wearable shoe insole with IoT technology for elderly care. Our insole will utilize a photon, machine learning algorithm, cloud computing, interface design for mobile. Our inspiration draws from our own personal experiences with caring and cherishing our elderly loved ones. Additional inspiration draws from previously existing work on mapping and understanding elderly care footwear inside homes.

#### Reflections
* We started early, moved quickly, made decisions and stuck with it. I like collaborating with them because they are easy-going and relaxed. I think Hongxi will focus on machine learning, Upasana wants to work on conceptual sketches/diagrams, and I want to play with physical fabrication with the insoles. The material will be interesting to explore. 

#### Speculations
* We will draw inspiration from previous works we found online. We noticed there are IOT devices related to tracking within a home, but not as many tracking for specifically elders outside of home. Many of the devices for outside the home are for fitness and for individual users. These users are typically tracking for themselves, but our focus has a second user (the caretaker) who is the primary observer of the iot device outputs/serial monitor.

## Week 11: Progress Report 11 - 11/14/24
#### Reflections
* This past week was not as eventful because we are in between project 3 and 4.
* I completed my LLMs project and it was a success. I submitted the report and showed my project outcomes in class. I received helpful feedback from my peers and I think I could have included more comparative analysis between different variables and parameters.
* This current week I've been sketching out potential concepts and ideas with Upasana because we are planning on collaborating together

#### Speculations
* I speculate that things will ramp up quickly for the final project. I think we'll have a really cool idea and I'm excited to work with Upasana and Hongxi on this final project.
* I'm hoping that our project will be related to waste management or solve an everyday problem.


## Week 10: Progress Report 10 - 11/7/24
#### Reflections
* I just submitted TDF Project #3! Yay! It was certainly easier than project 1 and 2 because of a few reasons.
* It was good that I started early, asked many many questions, and looked for guidance when I needed help. I felt very comfortable with my progress because I had the energy to listen. I learned about the components that make up a working agent model including different types of parameters like temperature, variables, logic, math, etc. I was also able to see the breakdown of how each node affects my agent. Previously, I had worked with watsonx, but it was quite challenging to use. Now I have a deeper understanding of what it all means.
* I struggled a bit in the last stretch because of lack of time. The instructing team was helpful in providing their support and I was able to finish on time. Experiment 5 was a bit easier than I thought. I didn't have any major bugs, more just tweaks that I wanted to make to the agent's output style. 

#### Speculations
* I am not sure if this is something I want to utiize in my last project. Although it was interesting, I'm not the most fascinated in LLMs. I do think it sounds cool that I know how it works and what actions are needed to construct one.
* In the future, I can definitely see this being helpful. I think its a more advanced CTRL-F. I feel like it can help reduce redundancy in customerm service or even schoolwork.

## Week 9: Progress Report 9 - 10/31/24
#### Reflections
* Because this is a new week and a new project; I wanted to get started early to avoid any panic or concerns down the line. I paid close attention in class, especially following the tutorials live. It was helpful because I believe I had a really solid understanding of ZeroWidth.ai off the bat at the end of our first class. On Tuesday, I followed some of the tutorials to set up my account, watch TJ's tutorials, and successfully created a project with 2 working experiments. I was able to complete experiment 1 and 2 successfully. I'm currently stuck on experiment 3 as my monitor is not releasing any outputs. I followed the steps, but there is nothing showing. Additionally, I tried using my own knowledge base and other people's knowledge bases, but my agent would no longer respond. It would submit back empty responses which is an issue. I posted my question in the Slack channel, and hopefully will get help soon. I think I am off to a good start.

#### Speculations
* I speculate that as I continue my tutorials, I will learn more about LLMS to an intermediate knowledge. I am okay with not fully understanding it, but it will be great value to me to understand tokens, embeddings, flows, agents, and more. These definitions will enhance my overall understanding of how LLMs work.
* I should continue to be asking questions in the Slack, testing flows in the builder, and not procrastinating due to fear. I think this will help me stay on top of TDF for this project!

<sub> **Pictured Below:** Where I am currently stuck in Experiment 3. My monitor is not displaying anything!  </sub>

## Week 8: Progress Report 8 - 10/24/24
#### Reflections
* Our project came out nicely. We all collaborated really well together and was very understanding when each individual needed time away or wanted to contribute. I am really proud of how far we've come and the progress we've made together.
* We were able to display information on the OLED via the Web API

#### Speculations
* We could continue our effort through other customizable pieces. There could be different ways to display our visual aid with a different emotion.
* Abdi presented our information in a darker, heavier way, but I prefer lighter and less intense.
* I may want to take the technology and make my own shell out of it to consider the emotions that can be evoked. I spoke with Chris about it and he gave some really interesting insight.

## Week 7: Progress Report 7 - 10/17/24
Woah, I am tired this week! It has been a lot, but I've been tinkering away on my TDF assignments so that is good. I don't really feel as behind as when I first started, and its definitely due to asking for help, reaching out to the TA/instructing team, and watching my fair share of tutorials.

Something I really struggled with this week is understanding the basics. I took some time to take a step back to figure out what I am using and what it is all for. I watched some middle school Youtube tutorials and it was very helpful. Especially understanding the negative/positive pins and the rails/buses, and even how to read a breadboard.

<sub> **Pictured Below:** The Youtube Video that I watched </sub>

<sub> **Pictured Below:** My notes </sub>

<img width="500" alt="my notes" src="assets/IMG_9997.jpg">

#### Reflections
* Our team has resubmitted our proposal for review with Jeff and got really great feedback last week. We added three inputs with three outputs for our project 2. It will be really cool to see everything come together.
* I'm specifically focusing on getting the OLED to display literally anything, which worked! I was aable to display customized text as well. I'm planning on reading through Tommy's GitHub because I know it has a lot of relevant helpful material.
* I was able to solder for the first time and do really interesting things with the technology. I appreciate that my peers are willing to patiently show me how things are done. Shout out to Abdi and Kaylee for sure.
* I was able to successfully add a motion sensor that lights up when lights are attached to it. :D 

#### Speculations
* I will have challenges with 3D printing as I'm trying out Fusion 360 for the first time. I feel that Rhino is too complicated for my needs and that Fusion 360 might be better suited. I'm making some shapes and I just need to spend more time (that I don't have...)
* I think I will learn a lot about how APIs work on physical hardware. I think a lot of my past experiences were about APIs from a third person business perspective-- but I'm getting the chance to watch Omar actually connect it all together and how it will work.
* I'm excited to see the outcome of our work. It'll be really awesome.

## Week 6: Progress Report 6 - 10/10/24
Hi there. Happy week 6! It is spooky season officially. 

#### Reflections
I learned how to connected my particle 2 to my home network via the VPN. I had some help from Baurzhan which was very helpful. I had to download GlobalProtect as well as Particle CLI and played around with some terminal commands to successfully connect my particle 2. It worked out and I'm glad I am able to work on the micro-controller from home. I watched the tutorials, asked Chatgpt, and feel more comfortable using the particle 2. Although I'm deeply behind on my assignments, I am making general progress to catch up.

#### Speculations
My FSR sensor wasn't correctly sensing at the right places. I believe my pins are not at the right spot, but I can't tell from the pictures provided from the tutorials. I'm speculating that my final project 2 for TDF may include some sort of sensor. It was easier than I thought. To be honest, the explanations are really really hard to follow, but the images I can just do. It is satisfying, it feels like i'm completing a puzzle or crocheting. I know this stuff really stresses me out, so I made sure to get comfy, put on a movie, and get ready to work...

## Week 5: Progress Report 4 - 10/03/24
Hi there. This week has been very challenging for me in TDF. I've been preoccupied with personal things and work related things and did not have the opportunity to take time on TDF as I wanted to. 

I am meeting with a TA to get help; rather than lag behind. Additionally, I've been trying to show up to the Mdes Studio where my other peers are working on our assignments. So I can work with them-- rather than trying to figure it out on my own in my apartment late at night. 

In terms of progress

#### My Reflections
* I had many issues getting my photon 2 to come online. I had to go through Device Doctor and Chatgpt to eventually get it online.
<img width="1434" alt="Photon 2 is offline" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16c3103e-a625-490f-b445-cf46a65e2b27">


* I'm having issues with flashing the code that was provided.

![IMG_9384](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e04521c8-ab01-4693-9d62-763501dcb8c0)



#### My Speculations
* I will improve by connecting with my peers for help
* I will improve if I continue to ask ChatGPT for help
* I realized this type of work is unnecessary for me as I'm primarily a product designer and more focused on the bigger picture-- rather than to get it to work. 
 



## Week 4: Progress Report 4 - 09/26/24

Hi! It is the last week of September which is exciting. This week was much slower compared to the frenzy of TDF Project 1. Now we're moving into understanding the digital ecosystem.

#### My Speculations
* I will need to spend time learning firmware/hardware as it is unfamiliar to me. I've seen my friends arduino things together so I've seen it in real-life.
* I'm excited to work with really smart people to create something exciting.

#### My Blockers/Fears
* I've never done firmware before
* I missed monday's class because I was sick

#### My Plans
* Finish the assignment
* Study the powerpoint provided and have a good idea of the firmware model and how humans interact with it.
* How will I achieve platypus?

Here are two iterations of my digital ecosystem. I initially did health and fitneess, but felt it was too high-level and not interesting. So I tried again with more conceptual models of transportation & mobility.

<br> <br>
T&M were more interesting to me; especially because I can either drive or take the bus. The bus path has more interconnected technology that make it relatively painless for me. I realized i'm highly dependent on Google Maps throughout my entire journey. Interesting. I'm also curious about how the Clipper App, Clipper Machine, and CalCentral are connected. These are very interesting things I want to explore.

#### My Reflections on the TDF Project 1
Ugh, my report disappeared so now I'm re-writing it. So if you read and its choppy, its because I'm annoyed that I'm rewriting this.

Here are vases I was originally going to 3d model/print.

#### My Proudest Accomplishments
- [x] Spending time learning some new markdown formatting. Look at this cool checklist. _Sick, right?_ Also adding images.
- [x] 3d printing/modeling

## Week 2: Progress Report 2 - 09/12/24

Hi! This is my second progress report for TDF. A lot has been happening and we're in the third week of school. It has been busy, to say the least. 

#### My Reflections
* First half of this "week" was figuring out how to laser-cut. It was very nerve-wracking, but I did it and now I feel like I am a video game character that level-ed up and unlocked a skill. The next thing is 3d printing, but in order to 3d print; I need to 3d model. And I made the executive decision to prioritize other things in my life over TDF. I know I want to learn technical skills, so this is still very important to me. I also acknowledge that setting this aside means I have to pick up more slack when I come back to this.

#### My Proudest Accomplishments
* Looking ahead and timing submitting Github Progress Reports on time and consistently.
* Successfully setting up and laserprinting an object. üéâ
* Asking and collaborating with peers to laserprint an object. Watching their process.
* Spending a significant amount of time understand what Grasshopper does generally.
* Opening and testing grasshopper to some extent.

#### My Speculations
* Why does the professor want us to do Grasshopper when there are other tools like Blendr or even AI Text to CAD? I think I know why, but I want him to say why.

#### My Blockers/Fears
* This week I prioritized working on my portfolio and the studio class over TDF. I recognize that I didn't spend much time really getting to know Grasshopper/Rhino as I should have.
* I'm horrible at math and using grasshopper requires a level of geometry and calculus that I've forgotten. 
* I can't download Rhino on my personal laptop so I can't follow along in class.
* I'm afraid I'm not giving myself enough time to understand grasshopper at a deeper level.
* I get really tired at 5 PM when we're having class and it is hard for me to pay attention by the time it is 5 pm. I've been trying to bring snacks to prevent being completely exhausted.
* I'm afraid of submitting the TDF project due next Wednesday. I don't think I've learned much and don't have much to showcase from the last few weeks.
 
#### My Plans
* Next week, carve more time to practice Grasshopper/Rhino.
* Learn markdown formatting to add photos into this Github .readme file
* Ask others for help (peers, professors, design specialists, chatgpt)
* Submit the TDF project 1 on time.
* 3d print anything. 

  

## Week 1: Progress Report 1 - 09/05/24

Hi there! Welcome to my first entry of my progress report. This past week has been very stressful in the TDF world. I think this component/class is where I am the weakest because I avoided anything CS/math related throughout highschool/university. I am naturally adverse to anything technical, which is ironic because I am doing my Master of Design in Emerging Technology. 

#### My Reflections
* This course is definitely the most stressful and nerve-wracking due to my lack of technical skill. It requires me to stay up-to-date and very cognizant of what I do know and what I will need to learn (and the time it takes to learn) and how I will learn it. As a result, I've been thoroughly reading through all things and asking questions wherever I have concerns. (Asking in Slack, Whatsapp, Chatgpt, etc. I also reinforce a reminder that I'm here optionally and I'm paying for this. So get asking!!!) I've begun to notice an immediate pay-off (resulting from my fears): it seems some of my peers are asking the same questions, but days after I resolved them. Maybe my fear of being behind is forcing me to be so proactive that maybe I'll be "successful"? (Whatever I define as "success.")
* I reached out to my friends and chatgpt to understand how Github works and how to use it.
* I reached out to tutorials and videos to understand how Rhino works and how to use it.
* I think I am in a solid spot because I'm being very proactive.

#### My Proudest Accomplishments
* I spent a significant amount of time with Chatgpt understanding what Github even is, how it works, and why we are using it. (I also spent time understanding how Github relates to business users, developers, and product designers). ((I segwayed into learning how Jira integrates with Github))
  * From my understanding, Github houses the code and here is where you store any code-changes via branches. It is also good for collaboration/version control/asset keeping.
  * (((I forced a developer friend of mine to teach me how to write progress reports the easy way. He mentioned that the way I'm doing it right now is not industry-standard but the "easy-way". When deciding between which path to take; I'm a designer and I don't think its necessary for me to do it the industry-way...)))
* I spent a significant amount of time reading all the various links on Github so now I have a clear understanding of what is expected out of me and what I can come to expect in the coming weeks/months in the TDF course.
* I downloaded and watched several Rhino tutorials and have a very baseline understanding of how it all works.
* I watched/read up about the requirements for the first project of computational design.

#### My Speculations
* I'm excited that Github isn't as scary as it was last week. I can commit changes and navigate throughout pages. It will continue to be easier as I learn specific markdown formatting over time.
* I'm excited to actually 3D print something. I know it is probably easier than I'm making it out to be in my mind.
* I'm curious how the AI/ML portion will integrate into this phone stand design. I've been thinking about how I often prop my phone up on my laptop during class to hide my phone usage from professors. Sometimes I also prop my phone up during meetings when my camera is on so I can scroll on my phone whilst not looking away from the general camera square. 

#### My Blockers/Fears
* I don't really understand the difference between computational designer and product designer. I watched some of the videos but it started blurring/getting fuzzy in my mind.
* I don't know how to 3D model --> 3D print. I need to try it out myself this week.
* I am scared of burning my skin and giving myself an allergic reaction. 

#### My Plans
* I want to ask Mia how to use 3D printing. She seems to know a lot and I could learn a lot from her expertise from a peer-to-peer perspective.
* I need to spend time actually 3D printing something. Anything. I'm thinking something cute and funky like a Smiski. That is the most daunting process to me. 
* I need to watch more tutorials on how to create 3D models in Rhino and exporting to the Jacob's computer to print.
* I need to reach out in-person to my professors, design specialists, and faculty to introduce myself as a person.
* I need to figure out Grasshopper altogether. That part I left out because its a plug-in.
* I need to review markdown formatting page.
